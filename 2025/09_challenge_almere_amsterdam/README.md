## What Went Wrong

- Spent too much time in transitions (20:30);
- Poor nutrition strategy - consumed only 90g carbs while cycling, 46g while running, plus 1 isotonic drink during the run;
- Used untested nutrition products (bought during the day before the event);
- Starting the swim on the "inside" (overcrowded side);
- Should have had more bottle cages on the bicycle (from 2 to 4 cages) to also have plain water;
- Bike's power meter did not work - made it difficult for pacing correctly;
- Discovered that the problem was that I didn't calibrate it before the race;
- Arrived late on race day (only 1.5 hours before the start);
- I need to train for open-water swimming in windy conditions (with waves);
- Did not practice triathlon laces (this took some of my T2 time);
- Bib support was not in the right size and kept falling during running and cycling;
- Did not test the TriSuit before the race;
- Just realized that there were pockets in the TriSuit after the race;
- Did not use any sunscreen;
- Did not use any cap for protection during running;
- Should have used two swimming caps to have the swim goggles in place;
- Very windy conditions! Aerodynamic equipment would have made a significant difference - arm/calf covers and TT bike;

## What Went Well

- ZERO injuries during training cycle (!);
- Bike maintenance and waxing the day before;
- Running and Swimming pacing;
- Good training cycle and consistency;
- Practiced some cycling strategies (standing after deceleration or up-hill);
- Followed a structured training program prepared by a professional Triathlon Coach;
